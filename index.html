               <h2><i class="fas fa-tools"></i> Essential Tools</h2>
               <p>
                  I'll assume that you are a beginner. In that case, there are a few
                  tools that you need to know before getting into programming. 
               <h3>
                  VS Code
                  (or other code editor)
               </h3>
               First, you should learn how to use Visual
               Studio Code, which is a source code editor. 
               It is a free and powerful tool. In the beginning, I recommend learning some of the
               basic shortcuts and installing some of the extensions like ESlint,
               Prettier, or Live Server.
               <h3>The Command Line</h3>
               Next, you need to know about the Command-Line. You should learn what
               it is, and some of the basic commands like how to move around
               directories, how to create a new directory, or how to create a new
               file. 
               <h3>Version Control - Git and GitHub</h3>
               No matter what you do, as a developer, you need to know about Git. Git is a Version Control
               system used for tracking changes. It is usually used with GitHub,
               which is a code hosting platform. In the beginning, learning Git
               might be overwhelming, therefore you just need to know some of the
               basics like how to create a new Repository, how to clone a project,
               how to make a new commit, and how to pull and push the new changes.
               One of the best ways to practice Git is by working in a team. 
               <h3>Design tools - Figma</h3>
               The last tool is Figma. Figma is a design tool and is free to use for individuals.
               But here I want to talk about how to use Figma as a developer. As a
               developer, you might get designs from designers on your team. With
               Figma you can inspect the code of the elements and measure the
               layout. Therefore, you need to know how to read Figma design, like
               how to get the color, typography, or spacing right. 
               <br>
               Alright, so these are the tools that you need to know of when getting started. You don't
               need to know everything, but be sure that you understand the basics
               so that you can improve while learning to code.

               <h2><i class="far fa-file-code"></i> Programming Languages</h2>
               <p>
               <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
               Next, let's continue with programming languages. And let's start off by talking about Responsive Websites.
               Responsive websites are sites that look good and are usable on all devices or screen sizes. You probably know how important it is to build a responsive website, as people use so many different devices these days.
               So let's jump to the first two languages that you need to know to build a website: HTML and CSS.
               HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It it is used to build the skeleton for your website. HTML is not difficult to learn, but you might want to pay more attention to HTML forms as they will be fundamental in the future.
               CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This is a markup language but I also consider it to be a programming language. CSS is not necessarily difficult to learn but it's difficult to master.
               There are few topics that you want to pay more attention to like:
               <br>
               Box model - how margins, padding, and borders work together.
               <br>
               CSS units - used for expressing lengths (e.g: rem, vh, and vw).
               <br>
               Position - specifies the type of positioning method. It also confuses many people so make sure you spend some 
               time on it.
               <br>
               Variables - or Custom properties are entities that can be reused throughout a document. This is my favorite feature in CSS. They make working with CSS so enjoyable and you can create themes with just a few lines of code.
               <br>
               Media query - decides what to show on different screen sizes. They are a key component of responsive design.
               <br>
               Animation - lets an element change from one style to another. If you know how to use animation correctly, it makes your site stand out. Otherwise, it will make your website look unprofessional, so be careful.
               <br>
               Flexbox, CSS Grid - used for building Responsive layouts.
               <br>
               <h3>JavaScript - Fundamentals</h3>
               Alright, the next topic is JavaScript. JavaScript is a popular programming language and is widely used for Web Development, among other things.
               You will need to learn some of the basic features of the language like Data Types, Loops, and Conditionals.
               Then there are topics that you will want to dive deeper into.
               First, we have debugging. This is the process of finding and fixing errors. Here's a great in-depth guide to bug squashing to get you started.
               And no matter how good you are with programming, you will have errors in your scripts. This means you'll want to know about Error handling as well.
               Asynchronous programming is important, especially when you need to communicate with the server. So spend some time learning about Promises and Async/Await.
               <br>
               JavaScript - Browser
               <br>
               Let's move on to how JavaScript is used in the browser.
               First, you need to know what a Document Object Model or DOM is. Then you need to know how to get elements, how to change the classes, or how to change the style with JavaScript.

               <h2><i class="fab fa-vuejs"></i> Libraries and Frameworks</h2>
               <p>
                  Now it is time to look at some Frameworks.
                  On the CSS side you should choose a framework for reponsive web design:
                  Bootstrap  /  Material Design  /  W3.CSS
                  On the JavaScript side you should learn at least one modern framework:
                  React.js  /  Angular.js  /  Vue.js   /  W3.JS
                  Maybe the popularity of jQuery has passed the top, but it is still the most used JavaScript framework.
